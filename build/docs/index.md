# ca-bakery

`ca-bakery` is a tool based on [cake build](https://cakebuild.net/) which enables you to define your CI/CD pipeline in a `recipe.yml` file which is implemented using a custom DSL (Domain Specific Language).

The custom DSL is used to define:
- **Components:**  *projects part of the CI pipeline*
- **Environment:** *environment variables used by the CI pipeline*
- **Bundlers:** *a bundler is a collection of steps to be executed in order to create a bundle*
- **Artifacts:** *an artifact is a deployable component and it is built using one or more bundlers*

`ca-bakery` can be used to bundle multiple projects in one single deployable artifact. A common use case would be a web application composed by a NetCore backend project and an Angular client project that need to be bundled into a single deployable artifact where the NetCore app serves to the client the Angular app.

Components to be part of the build process must be defines in the `recipe.yml` file, as well as this they must implement a build script compliant to `ca-bakery`.

The `ca-bakery` pipeline is implemented in a script which can be executed both on the local dev machine and the integration server. This approach makes application based on `ca-bakery` reproducible anywhere.
