# ca-bakery

`ca-bakery` is a tool based on [Cake Build](https://cakebuild.net/) which allow you to define your CI pipeline in a `recipe.yml` file which is implemented using a custom DSL (Domain Specific Language).

Using the custom DSL you can define:
- **Components:**  *projects part of the CI pipeline*
- **Environment:** *environment variables used by the CI pipeline*
- **Bundlers:** *a bundler is a collection of steps to be executed to create a bundle*
- **Artifacts:** *an artifact is a deployable component and it is built using one or more bundles*

`ca-bakery` can be used also to bundle multple projects in one single deployable artifact. For instance you may be developing a web application composed by a NetCore backend project and an Angular client project as well as this you may want to bundle both applications in a single deployable artifact where the NetCore app would be serving the Angular app to the client.

Using  `ca-bakery`  you need just to make sure projects which are part of the CI pipeline must implement a defined interface and once done you can feed `ca-bakery` with your `recipe.yml` file.
